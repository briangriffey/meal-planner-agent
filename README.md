# Meal Planner Agent - Web Application

An AI-powered meal planning web application that uses Claude AI to generate personalized, nutritious meal plans. Built with Next.js, Prisma, and BullMQ for scalable, multi-user meal planning.

## Features

- **AI-Powered Meal Planning**: Uses Claude to generate personalized, nutritious meal plans
- **Multi-User Support**: Independent user accounts with secure authentication
- **Customizable Preferences**: Configure meals per week, servings, nutrition targets, and dietary restrictions
- **Meal History & Analytics**: Track previous meals and view nutritional analytics
- **Async Job Processing**: Queue-based meal plan generation with real-time progress tracking

- **Email Verification**: Secure email verification for new user accounts
- **Automated Marketing Emails**: GitHub webhook integration to send release announcements to all users

## Email Verification

New users must verify their email address before logging in to ensure account security and valid email addresses.

### Verification Flow

1. **Registration**: User creates account with email, password, and name
2. **Verification Email**: System automatically sends email with verification link (24-hour expiry)
3. **Email Verification**: User clicks link in email to verify their account
4. **Login**: User can now log in with their credentials

### Key Points

- Verification tokens expire after 24 hours
- Users cannot log in until email is verified
- Verification emails can be resent from the login page
- Existing users (created before verification was enabled) are automatically verified

### For Users

- Check your spam folder if you don't receive the verification email
- Click "Resend Verification Email" from the login page if needed
- Verification link expires in 24 hours - request a new one if expired

### For Developers

Email verification requires proper email configuration in `.env`:

```env
GMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD=your-app-password
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000  # or your production URL
```

**Resending Verification:**

Users can resend verification emails at: `/resend-verification`

**API Endpoints:**

- `POST /api/auth/register` - Creates user and sends verification email
- `GET /api/auth/verify-email?token=xxx` - Verifies email with token
- `POST /api/auth/resend-verification` - Resends verification email

## Automated Marketing Emails

The application automatically sends marketing emails to all users when you publish a new GitHub release. This feature uses GitHub webhooks to trigger email generation and delivery.

### Features

- **Automatic Triggering**: Emails are sent automatically when you publish a release on GitHub
- **AI-Powered Content**: Claude AI generates user-friendly marketing copy from your changelog
- **Professional Templates**: Branded HTML email templates with responsive design
- **Batch Processing**: Emails are sent in batches with rate limiting to avoid issues
- **Secure Webhooks**: GitHub signature validation ensures only legitimate webhooks are processed

### Setting Up GitHub Webhook

#### 1. Generate a Webhook Secret

First, generate a secure random secret for webhook signature validation:

```bash
openssl rand -hex 32
```

Save this value - you'll need it in steps 2 and 3.

#### 2. Configure Environment Variable

Add the webhook secret to your `.env` file:

```env
GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET="your-generated-secret-here"
```

**Important**: Use the same secret value in both your `.env` file and GitHub webhook settings.

#### 3. Configure Webhook in GitHub Repository

1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Click **Settings** → **Webhooks** → **Add webhook**
3. Configure the webhook:
   - **Payload URL**: `https://yourdomain.com/api/webhooks/github`
     - For local testing: `http://localhost:3000/api/webhooks/github`
     - For production: Use your deployed URL (e.g., `https://meal-planner.example.com/api/webhooks/github`)
   - **Content type**: `application/json`
   - **Secret**: Paste the secret you generated in step 1
   - **SSL verification**: Enable SSL verification (recommended for production)
   - **Which events would you like to trigger this webhook?**
     - Select "Let me select individual events"
     - Check only **Releases** (uncheck everything else)
   - **Active**: Check this box to enable the webhook

4. Click **Add webhook**

#### 4. Verify Webhook Configuration

After adding the webhook, GitHub will send a test ping. You should see:
- A green checkmark next to the webhook in GitHub settings
- A "Recent Deliveries" entry with HTTP 200 response

### Testing the Integration

#### Local Testing

Before deploying to production, test the webhook integration locally:

1. **Start Services**:
   ```bash
   # Terminal 1 - Web app
   pnpm dev

   # Terminal 2 - Worker
   export EMAIL_TEST_MODE=true
   pnpm dev:worker
   ```

2. **Send Test Webhook**:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/webhooks/github \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
       "action": "published",
       "release": {
         "tag_name": "v1.0.0",
         "name": "Version 1.0.0",
         "body": "## Features\n- New feature 1\n- New feature 2"
       }
     }'
   ```

3. **Expected Result**:
   - HTTP response: `202 Accepted`
   - Worker logs show job processing
   - `TESTEMAIL.html` file is created in project root
   - Email contains release notes with proper formatting

#### Automated Test Script

For comprehensive testing, use the automated test script:

```bash
# Ensure test mode is enabled
export EMAIL_TEST_MODE=true

# Run automated test
bash scripts/test-marketing-email-flow.sh
```

The script will verify:
- ✅ Webhook endpoint receives and validates the payload
- ✅ Job is enqueued in BullMQ
- ✅ Worker processes job successfully
- ✅ Claude AI generates marketing copy
- ✅ HTML email is rendered with brand styling
- ✅ Email contains release information

### Testing with Real GitHub Releases

Once deployed to production:

1. Create a new release in your GitHub repository
2. Publish the release
3. GitHub will automatically trigger the webhook
4. Within 30-60 seconds, all users will receive a marketing email
5. Check worker logs for job processing details

### Webhook Security

The webhook endpoint validates GitHub signatures to ensure authenticity:

- **Valid signature**: Webhook is processed, email job is queued (HTTP 202)
- **Invalid/missing signature**: Webhook is rejected (HTTP 401)
- **Non-release events**: Webhook is acknowledged but ignored (HTTP 200)

**Important**: Never commit your `GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET` to version control. Always use environment variables.

### Email Test Mode

For testing without sending real emails, enable test mode:

```bash
export EMAIL_TEST_MODE=true
```

When enabled:
- Emails are written to `TESTEMAIL.html` in the project root
- No actual emails are sent via SMTP
- Perfect for development and testing

### Troubleshooting

#### Webhook Returns 401 Unauthorized

**Cause**: Signature validation failed

**Solutions**:
- Verify `GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET` matches in both `.env` and GitHub webhook settings
- Ensure the secret has no extra whitespace or quotes
- Regenerate the secret and update both locations

#### No Email Generated

**Possible causes**:
1. **Worker not running**: Start worker with `pnpm dev:worker`
2. **Redis not accessible**: Check `REDIS_URL` and ensure Redis is running
3. **No users in database**: Run `pnpm db:seed` to create test users
4. **Email test mode not enabled**: Set `EMAIL_TEST_MODE=true` for local testing

#### Worker Fails with "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY not set"

**Solution**: Add your Anthropic API key to `.env`:
```env
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-your-key-here
```

#### Email Looks Wrong or Has Errors

**Solutions**:
- Check worker logs for Claude API errors
- Verify all packages built successfully: `pnpm build`
- Review `TESTEMAIL.html` for rendering issues
- Check marketing email renderer: `packages/core/src/services/marketing-email-renderer.ts`

## API Documentation

See [apps/web/API_TESTING.md](apps/web/API_TESTING.md) for comprehensive API endpoint documentation and testing instructions.

## Development Scripts

```bash
# Build all packages
pnpm build

# Start web dev server
pnpm dev

# Start queue worker
pnpm dev:worker
```

## Database Operations

All database operations run from `packages/database/` (single source of truth):

```bash
# Development migrations (interactive)
pnpm db:migrate

# Production migrations (non-interactive)
pnpm db:migrate:deploy

# Generate Prisma client
pnpm db:generate

# Open Prisma Studio (database GUI)
pnpm db:studio

# Push schema without migration (prototyping)
pnpm db:push

# Seed database
pnpm db:seed
```

**Note:** The `.env` file at the root is shared across all packages.

## How It Works

1. **User Registration**: Users create accounts with NextAuth.js authentication
2. **Configuration**: Users set preferences for meals, nutrition, and scheduling
3. **Job Queue**: When a user requests a meal plan, a job is queued in BullMQ
4. **Worker Processing**: The queue worker:
   - Loads user preferences and meal history from database
   - Creates MealPlannerAgent with connectors
   - Generates meal plan using Claude AI
   - Saves results to database
   - Sends email with meal plan
5. **Real-Time Updates**: User sees progress updates via polling
6. **Analytics**: Meal records are stored for analytics and variety tracking

## Gmail Setup

To enable email delivery:

1. Go to your Google Account settings
2. Navigate to Security > 2-Step Verification (enable if not already)
3. Scroll down to "App passwords"
4. Generate a new app password for "Mail"
5. Add the 16-character password to your user preferences in the web app

## Troubleshooting

### Database Connection Error
- Ensure PostgreSQL is running: `docker-compose ps`
- Check DATABASE_URL in `.env`
- Run migrations: `pnpm db:migrate`

### Redis Connection Error
- Ensure Redis is running: `docker-compose ps`
- Check REDIS_URL in `.env`

### Queue Jobs Not Processing
- Make sure the worker is running: `pnpm dev:worker`
- Check worker logs for errors
- Verify Redis connection

### Email Not Sending
- Configure Gmail App Password in user preferences
- Check email connector configuration
- Review worker logs for SMTP errors

## Production Deployment

For production deployment:

1. Set up PostgreSQL and Redis instances
2. Configure environment variables
3. Build the application: `pnpm build`
4. Run database migrations
5. Start web server: `cd apps/web && pnpm start`
6. Start worker: `cd packages/queue && node dist/worker.js`
