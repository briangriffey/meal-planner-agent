## Environment Variables

The SEM implementation requires Google Ads conversion tracking integration with Google Analytics 4.

### NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_ID

**Purpose**: Google Analytics 4 Measurement ID for tracking conversions from Google Ads campaigns.

**Type**: Public environment variable (accessible in browser)

**Format**: `G-XXXXXXXXXX`

**Required**: Yes (critical for conversion tracking)

**Configuration**:
```bash
# .env.local (development)
# .env.production (production)
NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_ID="G-XXXXXXXXXX"
```

**SEM-Specific Usage**:
- Tracks Google Ads conversion events: `sign_up`, `generate_meal_plan`, `enable_automation`
- Links Google Ads and Google Analytics for attribution reporting
- Enables remarketing audiences for Display and YouTube campaigns
- Powers conversion optimization in Smart Bidding strategies

**Setup Steps**:
1. Create Google Analytics 4 property (if not already created)
2. Link Google Ads account to GA4: Admin → Data Display → Google Ads Links
3. Import GA4 conversion events into Google Ads as conversion actions
4. Enable auto-tagging in Google Ads: Settings → Account settings → Auto-tagging
5. Set environment variable with GA4 Measurement ID

**Conversion Events Configuration**:

The following GA4 events should be imported as Google Ads conversions:

| Event Name | Value | Conversion Action Type | Primary Conversion |
|------------|-------|----------------------|-------------------|
| `sign_up` | Free | Sign-up | Yes |
| `verify_email` | Free | Sign-up | No |
| `generate_meal_plan` | Calculated | Engagement | Yes |
| `enable_automation` | Calculated | Engagement | Yes |

**Important Notes**:
- Auto-tagging must be enabled for proper attribution
- Conversion window: 30 days click, 1 day view (Google Ads default)
- Use GA4's data-driven attribution model (recommended)
- Cross-domain tracking not required (single domain deployment)

---

### NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_ADS_CONVERSION_ID

**Purpose**: Google Ads conversion tracking ID for dedicated conversion tracking (alternative to GA4 import).

**Type**: Public environment variable (accessible in browser)

**Format**: `AW-XXXXXXXXXX`

**Required**: No (optional if using GA4 conversion import)

**Configuration**:
```bash
# .env.production (production)
NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_ADS_CONVERSION_ID="AW-1234567890"
NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_ADS_CONVERSION_LABEL_SIGNUP="AbCdEfGhIjKlMnOp"
NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_ADS_CONVERSION_LABEL_MEAL_PLAN="QrStUvWxYzAbCdEf"
```

**When to Use**:
- If you need dedicated Google Ads conversion tracking separate from GA4
- For more granular control over conversion counting methods
- If implementing enhanced conversions for better accuracy

**Setup Steps**:
1. In Google Ads, go to Tools → Conversions → New conversion action
2. Choose "Website" and set up conversion tracking
3. Copy the Conversion ID (format: `AW-XXXXXXXXXX`)
4. Copy each conversion label for different actions
5. Implement the global site tag (gtag.js) with conversion tracking

**Note**: For simplicity, we recommend using GA4 conversion import rather than dedicated conversion tracking. This reduces implementation complexity and provides unified analytics.

   - Clear button text: "Get Started Free" (not "Submit")
   - Privacy notice below form

4. **Visual Hierarchy**:

## Measurement & Analytics

### Google Analytics 4 (GA4) Event Tracking

**Critical Events to Track**:

| Event Name | Trigger | Category | Value | Primary Conversion |
|------------|---------|----------|-------|-------------------|
| `sign_up` | User completes registration | Conversion | Free | Yes |
| `verify_email` | User verifies email address | Engagement | Free | No |
| `generate_meal_plan` | First meal plan generated | Conversion | Calculated | Yes |
| `view_meal_plan` | User views meal plan | Engagement | Free | No |
| `enable_automation` | User enables weekly automation | Conversion | High | Yes |
| `share_meal_plan` | User shares plan (if feature exists) | Engagement | Free | No |

**Event Parameters**:

For each event, include these parameters:
- `user_id`: Unique user identifier
- `timestamp`: Event timestamp
- `source`: Traffic source (organic, cpc, social, etc.)
- `campaign`: Campaign name (from UTM parameters)
- `ad_group`: Ad group name (from UTM parameters)

**Implementation** (already in place via `apps/web/lib/analytics/google-analytics.tsx`):

```typescript
// Example: Track sign_up event
gtag('event', 'sign_up', {
  method: 'email',
  user_id: userId,
  campaign: getCampaignParam(),
});

// Example: Track generate_meal_plan event
gtag('event', 'generate_meal_plan', {
  value: 1, // Can be used for value-based bidding
  currency: 'USD',
  user_id: userId,
});
```

---

### Google Ads Conversion Tracking

**Setup Methods**:

**Option 1: Import GA4 Conversions (Recommended)**

Advantages:
- Single implementation (use existing GA4 events)
- Unified analytics across platforms
- Easier to maintain

Steps:
1. In Google Ads, go to: Tools → Conversions → Import
2. Select "Google Analytics 4 properties"
3. Choose GA4 property
4. Import events: `sign_up`, `generate_meal_plan`, `enable_automation`
5. Configure conversion settings:
   - **Count**: One (count first conversion only)
   - **Conversion window**: 30 days (click), 1 day (view)
   - **Attribution model**: Data-driven (or Last Click initially)

6. Set conversion values:
   - `sign_up`: Value = $0 (free action, but important)
   - `generate_meal_plan`: Value = $10 (estimated engagement value)
   - `enable_automation`: Value = $50 (highest intent action)

---

**Option 2: Direct Google Ads Conversion Tag**

Use if you need more control or faster attribution (GA4 import has slight delay).

Implementation:
1. Create conversion action in Google Ads
2. Get conversion ID and label
3. Add to environment variables:
   ```bash
   NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_ADS_CONVERSION_ID="AW-123456789"
   NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_ADS_CONVERSION_LABEL_SIGNUP="AbCdEfGhIjKl"
   ```

4. Implement on conversion pages:
   ```javascript
   gtag('event', 'conversion', {
     'send_to': 'AW-123456789/AbCdEfGhIjKl',
     'value': 1.0,
     'currency': 'USD'
   });
   ```

---

### Enhanced Conversions

**What It Is**: Sends hashed first-party data (email, phone) to Google for better conversion matching.

**Benefits**:
- Improves conversion accuracy by 5-15%
- Better attribution in cookie-less environment
- Enables better automated bidding

**Implementation**:
1. Enable in Google Ads: Tools → Conversions → Settings → Enhanced conversions
2. Choose implementation method: "Google tag" (recommended)
3. Update conversion tracking to include user data:

```javascript
gtag('set', 'user_data', {
  'email': hashedEmail, // SHA-256 hashed
  'phone_number': hashedPhone, // SHA-256 hashed
  'address': {
    'first_name': hashedFirstName,
    'last_name': hashedLastName,
    'country': 'US'
  }
});

gtag('event', 'conversion', {
  'send_to': 'AW-123456789/AbCdEfGhIjKl'
});
```

**Privacy Compliance**:
- Hash all personal data before sending
- Update privacy policy to mention Google Ads enhanced conversions
- Ensure user consent (if in EU/UK, use consent mode)

---

### Value-Based Bidding Setup

**Goal**: Optimize for high-value conversions (users who engage more).

**Implementation Steps**:

1. **Assign Conversion Values**:
   - Sign-up: $0 (initial conversion)
   - Generate first meal plan: $10 (engagement signal)
   - Enable automation: $50 (high intent, recurring usage)

2. **Enable Value-Based Bidding** (Month 3+, after 50+ conversions):
   - Change bidding strategy to: "Maximize conversion value"
   - Set target ROAS (Return on Ad Spend): 300% initially
   - Allow 2-3 weeks for learning period

3. **Track Revenue** (if monetizing):
   - Pass actual revenue as conversion value
   - Update GA4 events to include `value` parameter
   - Example: Premium subscription purchase = $99 value

---

### Offline Conversion Tracking

**Use Case**: Track conversions that happen outside the website (e.g., phone sign-ups, email conversions).

**Setup**:
1. Enable auto-tagging in Google Ads (captures GCLID)
2. Store GCLID in database with user record
3. Upload offline conversions via Google Ads API or UI:
   - Go to: Tools → Conversions → Uploads
   - Upload CSV with: GCLID, conversion time, conversion name, value

**Example CSV Format**:
```csv
Google Click ID,Conversion Name,Conversion Time,Conversion Value,Conversion Currency
abc123xyz,generate_meal_plan,2026-01-28 14:30:00,10,USD
```

---

### Attribution Modeling

**Available Models**:
1. **Last Click**: Gives 100% credit to last click (Google Ads default)
2. **First Click**: Gives 100% credit to first click
3. **Linear**: Equal credit to all touchpoints
4. **Time Decay**: More credit to recent touchpoints
5. **Position-Based**: 40% first, 40% last, 20% middle
6. **Data-Driven**: Google's algorithm determines credit (recommended, requires 3,000+ conversions)

**Recommendation**:
- **Month 1-3**: Use Last Click (simple, good for learning)
- **Month 4+**: Switch to Data-Driven attribution (if have 3,000+ conversions)
- **Alternative**: Use Position-Based (40/20/40) for multi-touch journeys

**Setup**:
1. Go to: Tools → Conversions → Attribution
2. Select conversion action
3. Choose attribution model
4. Click Save

## Social Media Advertising Strategy

### Overview

While Google Ads captures high-intent users actively searching for meal planning solutions, social media advertising expands reach to users who may not yet realize they need an AI meal planner. Social platforms enable visual storytelling, precise demographic targeting, and cost-effective audience building.

**Strategic Positioning**: Social media advertising complements Google Ads by:
1. **Building Awareness**: Introducing Meal Planner Agent to users before they actively search
2. **Visual Engagement**: Showcasing beautiful meal imagery and app interface
3. **Persona Targeting**: Reaching specific demographics (parents, fitness enthusiasts, etc.)
4. **Retargeting**: Re-engaging users who visited the site but didn't convert
5. **Cost Efficiency**: Lower CPC/CPM than Google Search Ads ($0.50-$2.00 vs. $1.50-$3.50)

---

### Platform Selection Rationale

Based on competitive research and platform analysis, we recommend a **phased multi-platform approach**:

#### Tier 1: Core Platforms (Launch Immediately)

**Budget Allocation**: 40-50% of total social media budget

**Expected Performance**:

- Monthly Conversions: 75-150 (at $1,000/month spend)

---

#### Tier 2: Expansion Platform (Launch Month 2-3)

#### Creative Production for TikTok

**Video Production Approach**:

1. **User-Generated Content (UGC) Style** (Recommended)
   - Film with iPhone/smartphone (authentic feel)
   - Natural lighting (no studio setup)
   - Casual, conversational tone
   - Real users sharing experience (with permission)
   - Cost: $50-$200 per video (pay users or create in-house)

2. **Trending Format Remixes**
   - Monitor TikTok trending page daily
   - Adapt trending sounds/challenges to meal planning
   - Quick turnaround (trends move fast, 24-48 hour production)
   - Use CapCut (free TikTok video editor) for editing
   - Cost: $0-$100 per video (in-house creation)

3. **Quick App Demos**
   - Screen recording of app (QuickTime, iOS screen record)
   - Add text overlays, trending music in CapCut
   - Fast-paced editing (no segment longer than 3 seconds)
   - Cost: $0 (in-house)

**Tools**:
- **Editing**: CapCut (free, TikTok's editor), Adobe Premiere, DaVinci Resolve
- **Captions**: CapCut auto-captions, Descript
- **Music**: TikTok Commercial Music Library (licensed for ads), Epidemic Sound
- **Screen Recording**: QuickTime (Mac), iOS built-in, OBS (Windows)
- **Stock Footage**: Pexels, Pixabay (use sparingly - original content better)

**Content Calendar** (if launching TikTok):
- **Week 1-2**: Produce 10-12 videos (variety of hooks, formats)
- **Ongoing**: 2-4 new videos per week
- **Refresh**: Retire videos after 2-3 weeks (avoid ad fatigue)

---

#### Budget Allocation

##### Test Budget: $600-$800/month

**Campaign Structure**:
- **Reach Campaign** (Awareness): $400/month
  - Objective: Reach (maximize impressions)
  - Audience: Broad interests (food, fitness, lifestyle)
  - Creative: 5-7 entertaining videos (trending formats)
  - Goal: Brand awareness, build pixel data
  - KPI: CPM < $8, Reach 200K-400K users

- **Traffic Campaign** (Website Clicks): $200-$400/month
  - Objective: Traffic
  - Audience: Interest targeting (meal planning, cooking, nutrition)
  - Creative: 3-5 demo videos with strong CTA
  - Goal: Drive traffic to landing page
  - KPI: CPC < $2.00, CTR > 1%

#### Cross-Platform Retargeting Strategy

**Coordinated Retargeting Across Channels**:

1. **User Journey Tracking**:
   - User sees Meta ad → visits site (Meta Pixel + GA4 track)
   - User doesn't convert → added to retargeting audiences (Meta + Google + Pinterest)
   - User sees retargeting ads across all platforms (coordinated frequency cap)

2. **Sequential Messaging**:
   - **First Touch (Meta/Pinterest/TikTok)**: Awareness - "Discover AI meal planning"
   - **Second Touch (Google Display/Meta Retargeting)**: Consideration - "See how it works"
   - **Third Touch (Meta/Google Retargeting)**: Conversion - "Start free trial today"
   - **Fourth Touch (Email + Retargeting)**: Urgency - "Limited time offer"

3. **Coordinated Frequency Caps**:
   - **Meta**: 3 impressions per 7 days
   - **Google Display**: 5 impressions per 7 days
   - **Pinterest**: 4 impressions per 7 days
   - **Total**: Max 12 impressions per user per week across all platforms (avoid fatigue)

4. **Cross-Platform Exclusions**:
   - Exclude converted users from all ad platforms (mark as customer)
   - Exclude active trial users from conversion campaigns (shift to retention messaging)
   - Share customer lists across platforms (Google Customer Match, Meta Custom Audience, Pinterest Customer List)

---

- 5-7 app interface screenshots (key features, meal plan view, grocery list)
- 3-5 lifestyle photos (people cooking, families eating, meal prep setups)
- 2-3 before/after images (chaotic kitchen → organized, stressed → happy)

**Videos** (Minimum):
- 3-5 video ads (15-30 seconds each, problem-solution format)

- User-generated content campaigns (encourage users to share meal photos)

---

### Measurement & Analytics

#### Tracking Setup Requirements

**Meta Pixel Events** (Priority Order):
1. **PageView** - All page loads (auto-tracked)
2. **ViewContent** - Landing page view (track source/campaign)
3. **CompleteRegistration** - Free trial signup completed
4. **Lead** - Email verified
5. **Custom: generate_meal_plan** - First meal plan generated
6. **Custom: enable_automation** - Enabled weekly automation

**Google Analytics 4 Events** (Cross-Platform):
- All events above, plus source/medium/campaign tracking
- User journey funnel: Ad Click → Landing Page → Signup → Email Verify → First Meal Plan → Paid Conversion

**Pinterest Tag Events**:
- PageVisit, Signup, Lead (same as Meta)

**TikTok Pixel Events** (if launched):
- ViewContent, ClickButton, CompleteRegistration, Subscribe

---

#### Attribution Model

**Primary Attribution**: Last-Click (Meta default)
- User who clicked Meta ad and converted gets attributed to Meta

**Secondary Analysis**: Data-Driven Attribution (GA4)
- GA4 analyzes full user journey across touchpoints
- Provides credit to assisting channels (e.g., user saw Meta ad, then searched Google)

**Multi-Touch Attribution Reporting** (Monthly):
- Track: First-touch channel (where user first heard about us)
- Track: Last-touch channel (what drove final conversion)
- Track: Assist channels (touchpoints along the way)
- Example: User sees Meta ad (first) → searches Google (assist) → clicks Pinterest ad (last) → converts

**Why This Matters**:
- Meta may drive awareness but Google drives conversion (both valuable)
- Avoid over-crediting last-click channel
- Inform budget allocation (awareness channels need credit too)

---

### Troubleshooting & Optimization

#### Common Issues & Solutions

**Issue: High CPA (>$20)**

**Potential Causes**:
1. **Audience too broad**: Targeting millions of users, low relevance
   - Solution: Narrow targeting (add more interest layers, tighter demographics)

2. **Creative not compelling**: Low CTR, low engagement
   - Solution: Refresh creative, test new formats (video instead of image)

3. **Landing page poor**: High bounce rate, low conversion
   - Solution: A/B test landing page, improve message match

4. **Wrong audience**: Attracting users who won't convert
   - Solution: Review conversion quality, add negative interests, adjust demographics

---

**Issue: Low CTR (<0.8%)**

**Potential Causes**:
1. **Ad creative not eye-catching**: Blends into feed
   - Solution: Use bright colors, dynamic visuals, people in images

2. **Hook not strong**: Doesn't grab attention in first 3 seconds
   - Solution: Start with question, surprising stat, or bold claim

3. **Ad fatigue**: Same users seeing ad repeatedly
   - Solution: Expand audience, refresh creative, check frequency

4. **Irrelevant audience**: Targeting users not interested
   - Solution: Narrow interests, test different demographics

---

**Issue: Low Conversion Rate on Landing Page (<5%)**

**Potential Causes**:
1. **Message mismatch**: Ad promises one thing, landing page says another
   - Solution: Ensure ad copy matches landing page headline/value prop

2. **Too much friction**: Signup process too complicated
   - Solution: Simplify form (email only), remove unnecessary fields

3. **Weak value prop**: Benefits not clear
   - Solution: Strengthen headline, add social proof, emphasize "free" and "no credit card"

4. **Poor mobile experience**: Most traffic is mobile, page not optimized
   - Solution: Mobile-first design, fast loading, large CTA buttons

---

**Issue: Ad Disapprovals**

**Common Reasons**:
1. **Before/after claims**: Meta restricts health/weight loss claims
   - Solution: Avoid "lose weight", "get healthy" claims; focus on "meal planning" instead

2. **Too much text in image**: Old rule (no longer applies but still best practice)
   - Solution: Keep text under 20% of image area

3. **Landing page issues**: Broken link, slow loading
   - Solution: Test landing page, ensure fast load time

4. **Targeting restricted categories**: Accidentally selected special ad category
   - Solution: Ensure "Special Ad Categories" is set to "None"

**How to Appeal**:
- Click "Request Review" in Meta Ads Manager
- Provide explanation if policy violation was unintentional
- Usually resolved within 24-48 hours

#### Emergency Pause Checklist (Social Media)

If social campaigns are underperforming or spending too fast:

1. **Pause all campaigns immediately** (in Ads Manager)
2. **Review daily budgets** (set lower caps, e.g., reduce by 50%)
3. **Audit targeting** (are audiences too broad? Add more constraints)
4. **Check creative performance** (pause ads with CTR < 0.8% or CPA > $20)
5. **Review landing page** (is it loading? Converting properly?)
6. **Check pixel/tracking** (are conversions tracking correctly?)
7. **Re-enable only top performers** (campaigns with CPA < $14)
8. **Monitor hourly for 24 hours** (ensure stability)
9. **Gradually increase budgets** (20% per week once performance stabilizes)

---

#### Platform-Specific Best Practices

**Meta (Facebook & Instagram)**:
- ✅ Use Campaign Budget Optimization (CBO) with 3+ ad sets
- ✅ Refresh creative every 2-3 weeks (combat ad fatigue)
- ✅ Layer audiences (demographics + interests + behaviors)
- ✅ Exclude converters immediately (avoid wasted spend)
- ❌ Don't use too many ad sets (Facebook can't optimize with <$10/day per ad set)
- ❌ Don't edit campaigns during learning phase (first 50 conversions)

**Pinterest**:
- ✅ Use vertical images (1000x1500px performs best)
- ✅ Keyword targeting (users search on Pinterest)
- ✅ Long-term mindset (Pins live for months, not days)
- ✅ Seasonal content (plan 2-3 months ahead)
- ❌ Don't expect immediate results (Pinterest is slower but longer-lasting)
- ❌ Don't over-brand (native, inspirational content works better)

**TikTok**:
- ✅ Sound-on creative (TikTok users watch with sound)
- ✅ Hook in 1-2 seconds (fastest scroll speed)
- ✅ Native, UGC-style content (don't look like an ad)
- ✅ Ride trending sounds/challenges (relevance drives reach)
- ❌ Don't use polished, corporate creative (feels inauthentic)
- ❌ Don't launch without video production capacity (2-4 new videos/week needed)
