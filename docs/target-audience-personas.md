### Stage 4: Conversion

**Goal**: Convert trial user to paying subscriber

#### Prospect State

- **Emotional State**: Evaluating value, weighing cost, decision mode
- **Primary Questions**:
  - "Is this worth paying for?"
  - "Which plan should I choose?"
  - "Can I afford this?"
  - "What happens if I cancel?"
- **Behavior**: Trial ending, reviewing usage, comparing pricing
- **Mindset**: Needs final push, looking for value justification

#### Decision Factors
1. **Value Received During Trial**
   - Did it save time?
   - Did it reduce stress?
   - Did they like the meal plans?
   - Was it easy to use?

2. **Perceived ROI**
   - "This saves me $200/month on groceries, worth $10/month"
   - "This saves me 5 hours/week, worth it"
   - "I'm hitting my fitness goals, worth the investment"

3. **Pricing Psychology**
   - Monthly vs. annual (trade-off: commitment vs. savings)
   - Comparison to alternatives (cheaper than meal kits, dining out)
   - Relative to value received

4. **Risk Perception**
   - Can I cancel easily?
   - Is my payment info secure?
   - Will the price increase?

5. **Habit Formation**
   - "I'm already using this weekly, might as well keep it"

#### Touchpoints
1. **Trial Ending Emails**
   - Day 12: "Your trial ends in 2 days—here's what you'll lose"
   - Day 13: "Last chance: Subscribe and get 20% off your first month"

2. **"It's too expensive"**
   - Response: "You've saved $47 on groceries this week. This pays for itself."

3. **"I'll just use the free version"**
